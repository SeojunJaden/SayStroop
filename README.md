# SayStroop Project

## Overview
SayStroop is a website testing and validating the Stroop effect on participants. The goal of this website is to highlight the interference of automatic processing on controlled tasks through the Stroop effect. The website was built using Streamlit with integration of OpenAI's Whisper and Web-RTC for speech recognition. 

## Usage
Participants will visit the website and read a brief description of the Stroop effect. If participants consent to the experiment, we will keep a statement of written consent through name and special ID. Once a participant enters their information they will encounter a small prompt asking if they are ready and when they are, the experiment will occur. After a certain number of trials the experiment will conclude and the website will thank the participant for their time. For more details, visit the final research paper.

## Data Collection (to be completed)

## Aspects
- Interactive testing
- Participant information storage
- Automatic speech recognition
- Data collection
- Analysis

## Limitations and Future Improvements
- As of now, SayStroop is simply testing the validity of the Stroop effect, with deeper research and thought we could explore more complex tests with the Stroop effect.
- Fine tuning OpenAI's Whisper so that participants have a greater user friendly experience.
- Redesign of SayStroop, the current aestheic is simplistic and concise, in future iterations we could try something more bold.
